## üöÄ Getting Started

To run these notebooks on your local machine, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
-   A quantum computing library (e.g., Qiskit, Cirq). You can typically install the necessary libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install jupyter qiskit
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/satwiksps/schrodingers-repo.git](https://github.com/satwiksps/schrodingers-repo.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**

    ```bash
    cd schrodingers-repo
    ```

3.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can navigate to and open the `.ipynb` files.
